    <li>The Deserted Village by Oliver Goldsmith
    <li>Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain,
    <li>Where health and plenty cheared the labouring swain,
    <li>Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
    <li>And parting summer's lingering blooms delayed,
    <li>Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,
    <li>Seats of my youth, when every sport could please,
    <li>How often have I loitered o'er thy green,
    <li>Where humble happiness endeared each scene!
    <li>How often have I paused on every charm,
    <li>The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,
    <li>The never-failing brook, the busy mill,
    <li>The decent church that topt the neighbouring hill,
    <li>The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the hade,
    <li>For talking age and whispering lovers made!
    <li>How often have I blest the coming day,
    <li>When toil remitting lent its turn to play,
    <li>And all the village train, from labour free,
    <li>Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree,
    <li>While many a pastime circled in the shade,
    <li>The young contending as the old surveyed;
    <li>And many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground,
    <li>And slights of art and feats of strength went round;
    <li>And still as each repeated pleasure tired,
    <li>Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired;
    <li>The dancing pair that simply sought renown
    <li>By holding out to tire each other down;
    <li>The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,
    <li>While secret laughter tittered round the place;
    <li>The bashful virgin's side-long looks of love,
    <li>The matron's glance that would those looks reprove!
    <li>These were thy charms, sweet village; sports like these,
    <li>With sweet succession, taught even toil toplease;
    <li>These round thy bowers their chearful influence shed,
    <li>These were thy charms—But all these charms are fled.
    <li>Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,
    <li>Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;
    <li>Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,
    <li>And desolation saddens all thy green:
    <li>One only master grasps the whole domain,
    <li>And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain;
    <li>No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,
    <li>But, choaked with sedges, works its weedy way;
    <li>Along thy glades, a solitary guest,
    <li>The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;
    <li>Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,
    <li>And tires their echoes with unvaried cries.
    <li>Sunk are thy bowers, in shapeless ruin all,
    <li>And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;
    <li>And, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,
    <li>Far, far away, thy children leave the land.
    <li>Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a rey,
    <li>Where wealth accumulates, and men decay:
    <li>Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade;
    <li>A breath can make them, as a breath has made;
    <li>But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
    <li>When once destroyed, can never be supplied.
    <li>A time there was, ere England's griefs began,
    <li>When every rood of ground maintained its man;
    <li>For him light labour spread her wholesome store,
    <li>Just gave what life required, but gave no more:
    <li>His best companions, innocence and health;
    <li>And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.
    <li>But times are altered; trade's unfeeling train
    <li>Usurp the land and dispossess the swain;
    <li>Along the lawn, where scattered hamlets rose,
    <li>Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;
    <li>And every want to oppulence allied,
    <li>And every pang that folly pays to pride.
    <li>Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,
    <li>Those calm desires that asked but little room,
    <li>Those healthfulsports that graced the peaceful scene,
    <li>Lived in each look, and brightened all the green;
    <li>These, far departing seek a kinder shore,
    <li>And rural mirth and manners are no more.
    <li>Sweet Auburn! parent of the blissful hour,
    <li>Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power.
    <li>Here as I take my solitary rounds,
    <li>Amidst thy tangling walks, and ruined grounds,
    <li>And, many a year elapsed, return to view
    <li>Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,
    <li>Remembrance wakes with all her busy train,
    <li>Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.
    <li>In all my wanderings round this world of care,
    <li>In all my griefs—and God has given my share—
    <li>I still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,
    <li>Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down;
    <li>To husband out life's taper at the close,
    <li>And keep the flame from wasting by repose.
    <li>I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,
    <li>Amidst the swains to shew m book-learned skill,
    <li>Around my fire an evening groupe to draw,
    <li>And tell of all I felt, and all I saw;
    <li>And, as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue,
    <li>Pants to the place from whence at first she flew,
    <li>I still had hopes, my long vexations past,
    <li>Here to return—and die at home at last.
    <li>O blest retirement, friend to life's decline,
    <li>Retreats from care that never must be mine,
    <li>How happy he who crowns, in shades like these
    <li>A youth of labour with an age of ease;
    <li>Who quits a world where strong temptations try,
    <li>And, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!
    <li>For him no wretches, born to work and weep,
    <li>Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;
    <li>No surly porter stands in guilty state
    <li>To spurn imploring famine from the gate,
    <li>But on he moves to meet his latter end,
    <li>Angels around befriending virtue's friend;
    <li>Bends to the grave with unperceived decay,
    <li>While resigation gently slopes the way;
    <li>And, all his prospects brightening to the last,
    <li>His Heaven commences ere the world be past!
    <li>Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening's close,
    <li>Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;
    <li>There, as I past with careless steps and slow,
    <li>The mingling notes came soften'd from below;
    <li>The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,
    <li>The sober herd that lowed to meet their young,
    <li>The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,
    <li>The playful children just let loose from school,
    <li>The watch-dog's voice that bayed the whispering wind,
    <li>And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind,
    <li>These all in sweet confusion sought the shade,
    <li>And filled each pause the nightingale had made.
    <li>But now the sounds of population fail,
    <li>No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,
    <li>No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread,
    <li>For all the bloomy flush of life is fled.
    <li>All but yon widoed, solitary thing
    <li>That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;
    <li>She, wretched matron, forced in age, for bread,
    <li>To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,
    <li>To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,
    <li>To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;
    <li>She only left of all the harmless train,
    <li>The sad historian of the pensive plain.
    <li>Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,
    <li>And still where many a garden-flower grows wild;
    <li>There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
    <li>The village preacher's modest mansion rose.
    <li>A man he was, to all the country dear,
    <li>And passing rich with forty pounds a year;
    <li>Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
    <li>Nor e'er had changed, nor wished to change his place;
    <li>Unpractised he to fawn, or seek for power,
    <li>By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;
    <li>Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,
    <li>More skilled to raise the wretched tan to rise.
    <li>His house was known to all the vagrant train,
    <li>He chid their wanderings but relieved their pain;
    <li>The long-remembered beggar was his guest,
    <li>Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;
    <li>The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,
    <li>Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allowed;
    <li>The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
    <li>Sate by his fire, and talked the night away;
    <li>Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,
    <li>Shouldered his crutch, and shewed how fields were won.
    <li>Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,
    <li>And quite forgot their vices in their woe;
    <li>Careless their merits, or their faults to scan,
    <li>His pity gave ere charity began.
    <li>Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
    <li>And even his failings leaned to Virtue's side;
    <li>But in his duty prompt at every call,
    <li>He watched and wept, he prayed and felt, for all.
    <li>And, as a bird each fond endeament tries,
    <li>To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies;
    <li>He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,
    <li>Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.
    <li>Beside the bed where parting life was layed,
    <li>And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns, dismayed
    <li>The reverend champion stood. At his control
    <li>Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
    <li>Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
    <li>And his last faltering accents whispered praise.
    <li>At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
    <li>His looks adorned the venerable place;
    <li>Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,
    <li>And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.
    <li>The service past, around the pious man,
    <li>With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;
    <li>Even children followed, with endearing wile,
    <li>And plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile.
    <li>His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest,
    <li>Their welfare pleased him, and theircares distrest:
    <li>To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
    <li>But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven.
    <li>As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,
    <li>Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
    <li>Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
    <li>Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
    <li>Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
    <li>With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,
    <li>There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,
    <li>The village master taught his little school;
    <li>A man severe he was, and stern to view,
    <li>I knew him well, and every truant knew;
    <li>Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace
    <li>The day's disasters in his morning face;
    <li>Full well they laughed, with counterfeited glee,
    <li>At all his jokes, for many a joke had he:
    <li>Full well the busy whisper circling round,
    <li>Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned;
    <li>Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught
    <li>The love he bore to learning was in fault;
    <li>The village all declared how much he knew;
    <li>'Twas certain he could write, and cypher too;
    <li>Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
    <li>And ev'n the story ran that he could gauge.
    <li>In arguing too, the parson owned his skill,
    <li>For even tho' vanquished, he could argue still;
    <li>While words of learned length and thundering sound,
    <li>Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;
    <li>And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,
    <li>That one small head could carry all he knew.
    <li>But past is all his fame. The very spot
    <li>Where many a time he triumphed, is forgot.
    <li>Near yonder thorn, that lifts its head on high,
    <li>Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye,
    <li>Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,
    <li>Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retired,
    <li>Where village statesmen talked with looks profound,
    <li>And news much older than ther ale went round.
    <li>Imagination fondly stoops to trace
    <li>The parlour splendours of that festive place;
    <li>The white-washed wall, the nicely sanded floor,
    <li>The varnished clock that clicked behind the door;
    <li>The chest contrived a double debt to pay,
    <li>A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;
    <li>The pictures placed for ornament and use,
    <li>The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;
    <li>The hearth, except when winter chill'd the day,
    <li>With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;
    <li>While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for shew,
    <li>Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row.
    <li>Vain transitory splendours! Could not all
    <li>Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall!
    <li>Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart
    <li>An hour's importance to the poor man's heart;
    <li>Thither no more the peasant shall repair
    <li>To sweet oblivion of his daily care;
    <li>No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,
    <li>Nomore the woodman's ballad shall prevail;
    <li>No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,
    <li>Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;
    <li>The host himself no longer shall be found
    <li>Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;
    <li>Nor the coy maid, half willing to be prest,
    <li>Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.
    <li>Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,
    <li>These simple blessings of the lowly train;
    <li>To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
    <li>One native charm, than all the gloss of art;
    <li>Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,
    <li>The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;
    <li>Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,
    <li>Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined.
    <li>But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,
    <li>With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed,
    <li>In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,
    <li>The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;
    <li>And, even while fashion's brightest arts ecoy,
    <li>The heart distrusting asks, if this be joy.
    <li>Ye friends to truth, ye statesmen who survey
    <li>The rich man's joys encrease, the poor's decay,
    <li>'Tis yours to judge, how wide the limits stand
    <li>Between a splendid and a happy land.
    <li>Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,
    <li>And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;
    <li>Hoards even beyond the miser's wish abound,
    <li>And rich men flock from all the world around.
    <li>Yet count our gains. This wealth is but a name
    <li>That leaves our useful products still the same.
    <li>Not so the loss. The man of wealth and pride
    <li>Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
    <li>Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,
    <li>Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds:
    <li>The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,
    <li>Has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth;
    <li>His seat, where solitary sports are seen,
    <li>Indignant spurns the cottage from te green:
    <li>Around the world each needful product flies,
    <li>For all the luxuries the world supplies.
    <li>While thus the land adorned for pleasure, all
    <li>In barren splendour feebly waits the fall.
    <li>As some fair female unadorned and plain,
    <li>Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,
    <li>Slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies,
    <li>Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes.
    <li>But when those charms are past, for charms are frail,
    <li>When time advances, and when lovers fail,
    <li>She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,
    <li>In all the glaring impotence of dress.
    <li>Thus fares the land, by luxury betrayed:
    <li>In nature's simplest charms at first arrayed;
    <li>But verging to decline, its splendours rise,
    <li>Its vistas strike, its palaces surprize;
    <li>While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,
    <li>The mournful peasant leads his humble band;
    <li>And while he sinks, without one arm to save,
    <li>Th country blooms—a garden, and a grave.
    <li>Where then, ah where, shall poverty reside,
    <li>To scape the pressure of contiguous pride?
    <li>If to some common's fenceless limits strayed,
    <li>He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,
    <li>Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,
    <li>And ev'n the bare-worn common is denied.
    <li>If to the city sped—What waits him there?
    <li>To see profusion that he must not share;
    <li>To see ten thousand baneful arts combined
    <li>To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;
    <li>To see those joys the sons of pleasure know,
    <li>Extorted from his fellow-creature's woe.
    <li>Here while the courtier glitters in brocade,
    <li>There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;
    <li>Here while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,
    <li>There the black gibbet glooms beside the way.
    <li>The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign,
    <li>Here, richly deckt, admits the gorgeous train;
    <li>Tumultuous grandeur crwds the blazing square,
    <li>The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.
    <li>Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!
    <li>Sure these denote one universal joy!
    <li>Are these thy serious thoughts?—Ah, turn thine eyes
    <li>Where the poor houseless shivering female lies.
    <li>She once, perhaps, in village plenty blest,
    <li>Has wept at tales of innocence distrest;
    <li>Her modest looks the cottage might adorn
    <li>Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:
    <li>Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,
    <li>Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,
    <li>And, pinch'd with cold, and shrinking from the shower,
    <li>With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour
    <li>When idly first, ambitious of the town,
    <li>She left her wheel and robes of country brown.
    <li>Do thine, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest train,
    <li>Do thy fair tribes participate her pain?
    <li>Even now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,
    <li>At proud men's doors the ask a little bread!
    <li>Ah, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene,
    <li>Where half the convex world intrudes between,
    <li>Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,
    <li>Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.
    <li>Far different there from all that charm'd before,
    <li>The various terrors of that horrid shore;
    <li>Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,
    <li>And fiercely shed intolerable day;
    <li>Those matted woods where birds forget to sing,
    <li>But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;
    <li>Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned,
    <li>Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;
    <li>Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
    <li>The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;
    <li>Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,
    <li>And savage men, more murderous still than they;
    <li>While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,
    <li>Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.
    <li>Far different these from every frmer scene,
    <li>The cooling brook, the grassy vested green,
    <li>The breezy covert of the warbling grove,
    <li>That only shelter'd thefts of harmless love.
    <li>Good Heaven! what sorrows gloom'd that parting day,
    <li>That called them from their native walks away;
    <li>When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,
    <li>Hung round their bowers, and fondly looked their last,
    <li>And took a long farewell, and wished in vain
    <li>For seats like these beyond the western main;
    <li>And shuddering still to face the distant deep,
    <li>Returned and wept, and still returned to weep.
    <li>The good old sire the first prepared to go
    <li>To new found worlds, and wept for others woe.
    <li>But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,
    <li>He only wished for worlds beyond the grave.
    <li>His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,
    <li>The fond companion of his helpless years,
    <li>Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,
    <li>And left a lover's for a father's arms
    <li>With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,
    <li>And blessed the cot where every pleasure rose;
    <li>And kist her thoughtless babes with many a tear,
    <li>And claspt them close, in sorrow doubly dear;
    <li>Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
    <li>In all the silent manliness of grief.
    <li>O luxury! thou curst by Heaven's decree,
    <li>How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!
    <li>How do thy potions, with insidious joy,
    <li>Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy!
    <li>Kingdoms, by thee, to sickly greatness grown,
    <li>Boast of a florid vigour not their own;
    <li>At every draught more large and large they grow,
    <li>A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;
    <li>Till sapped their strength, and every part unsound,
    <li>Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round.
    <li>Even now the devastation is begun,
    <li>And half the business of destruction done;
    <li>Even now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,
    <li>I see the rural virues leave the land:
    <li>Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail,
    <li>That idly waiting flaps with every gale,
    <li>Downward they move, a melancholy band,
    <li>Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand.
    <li>Contented toil, and hospitable care,
    <li>And kind connubial tenderness, are there;
    <li>And piety with wishes placed above,
    <li>And steady loyalty, and faithful love.
    <li>And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid,
    <li>Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;
    <li>Unfit in these degenerate times of shame,
    <li>To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;
    <li>Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,
    <li>My shame in crowds, my solitary pride;
    <li>Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,
    <li>That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so;
    <li>Thou guide by which the nobler arts excell,
    <li>Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!
    <li>Farewell, and O where'er thy voice be tried,
    <li>On Torno's cliffs or Pambamarca's side,
    <li>Whether were equinoctial fervours glow,
    <li>Or winter wraps the polar world in snow,
    <li>Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,
    <li>Redress the rigours of the inclement clime;
    <li>Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain,
    <li>Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;
    <li>Teach him, that states of native strength possest,
    <li>Tho' very poor, may still be very blest;
    <li>That trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,
    <li>As ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away;
    <li>While self-dependent power can time defy,
    <li>As rocks resist the billows and the sky.

    <li>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by Dylan Thomas
    <li>Do not go gentle into that good night,
    <li>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
    <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    <li>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
    <li>Because their words had forked no lightning they
    <li>Do not go gentle into that good night.
    <li>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
    <li>Their fril deeds might have danced in a green bay,
    <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    <li>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
    <li>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
    <li>Do not go gentle into that good night.
    <li>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
    <li>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
    <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    <li>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
    <li>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
    <li>Do not go gentle into that good night.
    <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

    <li>The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe
    <li>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    <li>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    <li>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    <li>As of some one gently rapping, raping at my chamber door.
    <li>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
    <li>Only this and nothing more.”
    <li>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
    <li>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    <li>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    <li>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
    <li>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
    <li>Nameless here for evermore.
    <li>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
    <li>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    <li>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    <li>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
    <li>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
    <li>This it is and nothing more.”
    <li>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
    <li>“Sir,” said , “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    <li>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    <li>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
    <li>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
    <li>Darkness there and nothing more.
    <li>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
    <li>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    <li>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    <li>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
    <li>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
    <li>Merely this and nothing more.
    <li>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
    <li>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
    <li>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
    <li>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
    <liLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
    <li>’Tis the wind and nothing more!”
    <li>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
    <li>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
    <li>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
    <li>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
    <li>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
    <li>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    <li>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
    <li>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
    <li>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
    <li>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
    <li>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
    <li>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    <li>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
    <li>Though its aswer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
    <li>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    <li>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
    <li>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
    <li>With such name as “Nevermore.”
    <li>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
    <li>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    <li>Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
    <li>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
    <li>On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
    <li>Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
    <li>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
    <li>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
    <li>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    <li>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
    <li>Till the dirges f his Hope that melancholy burden bore
    <li>Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
    <li>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
    <li>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
    <li>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
    <li>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
    <li>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
    <li>Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
    <li>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
    <li>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
    <li>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    <li>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
    <li>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
    <li>She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    <li>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
    <li>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted foor.
    <li>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
    <li>Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
    <li>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
    <li>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    <li>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
    <li>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    <li>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
    <li>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
    <li>Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
    <li>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    <li>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
    <li>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
    <li>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
    <li>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
    <li>Clasp a rar and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
    <li>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    <li>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
    <li>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
    <li>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    <li>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
    <li>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
    <li>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
    <li>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
    <li>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
    <li>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
    <li>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
    <li>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
    <li>Shall be lifted—nevermore!

    <li>The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost
    <li>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    <li>And sorry I could not travel both
    <li>And be one traveler, long I stood
    <li>And looked down one as far as I could
    <li>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    <li>Then took the other, as just as fair,
    <li>And having perhaps the better claim,
    <li>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <li>Though as for that the passing there
    <li>Had worn them really about the same,
    <li>And both that morning equally lay
    <li>In leaves no step had trodden black.
    <li>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    <li>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    <li>I doubted if I should ever come back.
    <li>I shall be telling this with a sigh
    <li>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    <li>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    <li>I took the one less traveled by,
    <li>And that has made all the difference.

    <li>Ode to a Nightingale by John Keats
    <li>My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
    <li>My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
    <li>Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
    <li>One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
    <li>'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
    <li>But being too happy in thine happiness,—
    <li>That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
    <li>In some melodious plot
    <li>Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
    <li>Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
    <li>O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
    <li>Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
    <li>Tasting of Flora and the country green,
    <li>Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
    <li>O for a beaker full of the warm South,
    <li>Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
    <li>With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
    <li>And purple-stained mouth;
    <li>That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
    <li>And with thee fade awy into the forest dim:
    <li>Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
    <li>What thou among the leaves hast never known,
    <li>The weariness, the fever, and the fret
    <li>Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
    <li>Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
    <li>Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
    <li>Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
    <li>And leaden-eyed despairs,
    <li>Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
    <li>Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
    <li>Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
    <li>Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
    <li>But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
    <li>Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
    <li>Already with thee! tender is the night,
    <li>And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
    <li>Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
    <li>But here there is no light,
    <li>Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
    <li>Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
   <li>I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
    <li>Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
    <li>But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
    <li>Wherewith the seasonable month endows
    <li>The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
    <li>White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;
    <li>Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
    <li>And mid-May's eldest child,
    <li>The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
    <li>The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
    <li>Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
    <li>I have been half in love with easeful Death,
    <li>Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
    <li>To take into the air my quiet breath;
    <li>Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
    <li>To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
    <li>While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
    <li>In such an ecstasy!
    <li>Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—
    <li>To thy high requiem become a sod.
    <li>Thou wast not born for death, immortalBird!
    <li>No hungry generations tread thee down;
    <li>The voice I hear this passing night was heard
    <li>In ancient days by emperor and clown:
    <li>Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
    <li>Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
    <li>She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
    <li>The same that oft-times hath
    <li>Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
    <li>Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
    <li>Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
    <li>To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
    <li>Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
    <li>As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
    <li>Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
    <li>Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
    <li>Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
    <li>In the next valley-glades:
    <li>Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
    <li>Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?

    <li>Jubilate Agno by Christopher Smart
    <li>For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.
    <li>For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.
    <li>For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.
    <li>For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.
    <li>For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.
    <li>For he rolls upon prank to work it in.
    <li>For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.
    <li>For this he performs in ten degrees.
    <li>For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.
    <li>For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.
    <li>For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.
    <li>For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.
    <li>For fifthly he washes himself.
    <li>For sixthly he rolls upon wash.
    <li>For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted uon the beat.
    <li>For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.
    <li>For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.
    <li>For tenthly he goes in quest of food.
    <li>For having consider'd God and himself he will consider his neighbour.
    <li>For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.
    <li>For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.
    <li>For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.
    <li>For when his day's work is done his business more properly begins.
    <li>For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary.
    <li>For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.
    <li>For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.
    <li>For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.
    <li>For he is of the tribe of Tiger.
    <li>For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.
    <li>For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses
    <li>For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.
    <li>For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he's a good Cat.
    <li>For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.
    <li>For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.
    <li>For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.
    <li>For every family had one cat at least in the bag.
    <li>For the English Cats are the best in Europe.
    <li>For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.
    <li>For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.
    <li>For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.
    <li>For he is tenacious of his point.
    <li>For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.
    <li>For he knows that God is his Saviour.
    <li>For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.
    <li>For there s nothing brisker than his life when in motion.
    <li>For he is of the Lord's poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.
    <li>For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.
    <li>For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.
    <li>For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.
    <li>For he is docile and can learn certain things.
    <li>For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.
    <li>For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.
    <li>For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.
    <li>For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.
    <li>For he can jump from an eminence into his master's bosom.
    <li>For he can catch the cork and toss it again.
    <li>For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.
    <li>For the former is afraid of detection.
    <li>For the latter rfuses the charge.
    <li>For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.
    <li>For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.
    <li>For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.
    <li>For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.
    <li>For his ears are so acute that they sting again.
    <li>For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.
    <li>For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.
    <li>For I perceived God's light about him both wax and fire.
    <li>For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.
    <li>For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.
    <li>For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.
    <li>For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.
    <li>For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.
    <li>For he can swim for life.
    <li>For he can creep.

    <li>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

    <li>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
    <li>The best lack all conviction, while the worst
    <li>Are full of passionate intensity.
    <li>Surely some revelation is at hand;
    <li>Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
    <li>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
    <li>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
    <li>Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
    <li>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
    <li>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
    <li>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
    <li>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
    <li>The darkness drops again; but now I know
    <li>That twenty centuries of stony sleep
    <li>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
    <li>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
    <li>Slouches owards Bethlehem to be born?

    <li>She Walks in Beauty by Load Byron
    <li>She walks in beauty, like the night
    <li>Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
    <li>And all that’s best of dark and bright
    <li>Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
    <li>Thus mellowed to that tender light
    <li>Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
    <li>One shade the more, one ray the less,
    <li>Had half impaired the nameless grace
    <li>Which waves in every raven tress,
    <li>Or softly lightens o’er her face;
    <li>Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
    <li>How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
    <li>And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
    <li>So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
    <li>The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
    <li>But tell of days in goodness spent,
    <li>A mind at peace with all below,
    <li>A heart whose love is innocent!
    <li>============================================================================================
    <li>Sonnet 18 by William Shakespeare
    <li>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
    <li>Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
    <li>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    <li>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
    <li>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
    <li>And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
    <li>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
    <li>By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
    <li>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
    <li>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
    <li>Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
    <li>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
    <li>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    <li>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
    <li>THAT WAS THE LAST POEM!</li>
